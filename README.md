### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Bart. I work in infosec or information security, mainly as a blue teamer. 
On my Github, you can find multiple projects I've created. 
I write articles on my blog: https://bartblaze.blogspot.com/


### Support 

Did I help you out? Consider buying me a coffee! Thank you for your support.
